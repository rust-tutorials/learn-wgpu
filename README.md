# Learn WGPU

Hello, Lokathor here.

This repo used to be the home of a tutorial for `wgpu`, but it got outdated and useless. It's still available in the `old-master` branch, if you really want it.

The current, most actively updated guide for `wgpu` that I know about is being written by `sotrh`:

https://github.com/sotrh/learn-wgpu

Perhaps some day they'll have the time and inclination to move their work into this repo, but until then I'm just going to link you over there.
